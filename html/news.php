                    Each problem on the website has an unlock value and a total point value. </p>
                <p>When you click on one of the unlocked problems, you will see the problem and a place to submit your code. After uploading your file,
                    our system will automatically check multiple test cases to ensure that your code satisfies all test cases. The bar above the problem
                    will show you the number of test cases you have completed as well as the ones you have not. You can continue uploading code until all
                    test cases satisfy your code. For each test case completed you get a percentage of the total points the question is worth.</p>

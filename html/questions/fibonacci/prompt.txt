Farmer John was always fascinated by the fibonacci numbers, but his math is terrible and cannot calculate any of the fibonacci numbers.

Help Farmer John by writing a program that prints out the Nth (1<=N<=75) fibonacci number.

Note that the fibonacci numbers can become very big, so to avoid integer overflow you can use long in java or long long in c++.

INPUT FORMAT (file fibonacci.in):

The first line contains an integer N (1<=N<=75).

OUTPUT FORMAT (file fibonacci.out):

Output, on a single line, the Nth fibonacci number.

SAMPLE INPUT:

1

SAMPLE OUTPUT:

1

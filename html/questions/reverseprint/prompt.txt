Farmer John, Engineer John's big brother wants EJ's help on his farm. Recently, FJ is bored out of his mind and found a hobby of reversing the order of his cows on the farm. However, new cows arrive everyday, increasing the number of cows he has to reverse. So, FJ wants EJ to write a program that reverse the order of N (1≤N≤10^3) cows, with each cow conveniently labled as X (1≤X≤10^5).

Help EJ write a program to print the order of FJ's cows in reverse order.

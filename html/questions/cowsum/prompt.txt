Farmer John has N (1<=N<=50) cows that can be defined with many different attributes such as weight, height, width, length with values v_i (1<=v_i<=10^6).

These cows also visit Farmer John's field at a certain time t_i and eats grass until the time t_j, where the cow then leaves. The cow leaves leaves at t_j, so it is unable to eat any grass exactly on time t_j.

Farmer John wants to identify the maximum of each attribute at a certain point of time, T (1<=T<=10^6), on the field.

Note that you should practice using a class for the cows or a struct for c++.

INPUT FORMAT (file cowsum.in)

The first line contains two integers N and T. The next N lines contains six variables describing the weight, height, width, length, t_i, and t_j of each cow respectively. It is guaranteed that t_i < t_j.

OUTPUT FORMAT (file cowsum.out)

The output should contain four lines with an integer on each line defining the maximum of each attribute at T time. If there are no cows at T time, print out -1 for each attribute.

SAMPLE INPUT:

2 3
2 3 4 5 1 4
3 4 5 3 3 5

SAMPLE OUTPUT:

3
4
5
5

The maximum of attributes at time 3 is outputed.

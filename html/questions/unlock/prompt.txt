Unlocking Blocks

A little-known fact about cows is that they love puzzles! For Bessie's<br>birthday, Farmer John gives her an interesting mechanical puzzle for her to<br>solve.  The puzzle consists of three solid objects, each of which is built<br>from 1x1 unit squares glued together.  Each of these objects is a<br>"connected" shape,  in the sense that you can get from one square on the<br>object to any other square on the object by stepping north, south, east, or<br>west, through squares on the object.<br><br>An object can be moved by repeatedly sliding it either north, south,<br>east, or west one unit.  The goal of the puzzle is to move the objects<br>so that they are separated -- where their bounding boxes no longer<br>share any positive overlap with each-other.  Given the shapes and<br>locations of the three objects, your task is to help Bessie decide<br>what is the minimum number of individual slides required to separate<br>the objects.

All coordinates lie in the range 0..9.<br><br>* Lines 2+N1..1+N1+N2: Each of these lines describes the (x,y)<br>        location of the south-west corner of single square that is<br>        part of object 2.  All coordinates lie in the range 0..9.<br><br>* Lines 2+N1+N2..1+N1+N2+N3: Each of these lines describes the (x,y)<br>        location of the south-west corner of single square that is<br>        part of object 3.

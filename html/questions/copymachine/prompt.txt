Engineer John has been assigned a simple assignment for his one is classes. He needs to take N numbers (1≤N≤50) with values of X (1≤X≤10^5) and copy them. However, engineer John is lazy and does not 
want to copy them down by hand. Instead, John wants to use his handy-dandy computer to help him do the work.

Please help John write a program to print out N numbers with a value of X. 

SCORING: 
    •Test cases 1 - 10 statisfy N ≤ 20 and X ≤ 50.
    •Test cases 11 - 50 will satisfy no additional constraints

INPUT FORMAT (file copymachine.in):

The first line of the input file contains one positive integer N. The next N lines will each contain the integers
with a value of X.

OUTPUT FORMAT (file copymachine.out):

Print out N lines of integers.

SAMPLE INPUT:
1
1

SAMPLE OUTPUT:
1

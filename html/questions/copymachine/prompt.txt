Copy Machine
============

Engineer John has been assigned a simple assignment for his one is classes. He needs to
take N numbers (1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5) with values of X_i (1 ≤ X_i ≤ 10^5) and copy them. However, engineer John is lazy and does not
want to copy them down by hand. Instead, John wants to use his handy-dandy computer to help him do the work.

SCORING: 
	•Test cases 1 - 10 satisfy N ≤ 20 and X ≤ 50.
	•Test cases 11 - 50 will satisfy no additional constraints

INPUT FORMAT (file copy.in):

The first line of the input file contains one positive integer N. The next N lines will each contain the integers
with a value of X_i.

OUTPUT FORMAT (file copy.out):

Print out N lines of integers.

SAMPLE INPUT:
1
1

SAMPLE OUTPUT:
1

Farmer John gained an interest in spirals ever since he discovered the fibonacci numbers made a spiral. He now sees spirals in every object, especially in square matrices. However, when the square matrices get too big, it becomes hard for him to picture the spirals.

Help Farmer John picture a spiral for an N by N matrix (1<=N<=1000) where each element, X_ij (1<=X<=1000000), is printed once in as you spirally traverse the matrix.

Farmer John likes his spirals to spiral in this pattern: top left -> top right -> bottom right -> bottom left -> top left...

INPUT FORMAT (file spiralprint.in)

The first line contains an integer N. The next N lines contain N integers X_ij, where X_ij is the in the ith row and jth column of the matrix.

OUTPUT FORMAT (file spiralprint.out)

The output contains N^2 lines that are elements from the matrix.

SAMPLE INPUT:

3
10 2 3
6 5 3
11 8 9

SAMPLE OUTPUT:

10
2
3
3
9
8
11
6
5

The matrix is printed as follows: 10 -> 3 -> 9 -> 11 -> 6 -> 5.

Even Steven, Enginner John's cousin, is over at EJ's house for dinner today. During dinner, ES asked EJ to help him solve a problem. The problem contained a single integer N (1≤N≤10^5). ES wants EJ to tell him all the even numbers between 1 - N. However, like always, EJ is too lazy and would like to use his handy-dandy computer to do the problem.

Help EJ write a program to print all even numbers from 1 - N;

INPUT FORMAT (file evensteven.in):

The first line of the input file contains one positive integer N.

OUTPUT FORMAT (file evensteven.out):

Print out all even numbers from 1 - N

SAMPLE INPUT:

10

SAMPLE OUTPUT:

2
4
6
8
10

2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 are all even numbers between 1 - 10.

Engineer John's mom wants him to practice writing numbers, but the numbers, N(0≤N≤10^5), can get really big. Instead, he wants to use his handy-dandy computer to do the job for him.

Help Engineer John write a program that prints out a number, N.

SCORING: 
	•Test cases 1 - 10 statisfy 0≤N≤10.
	•Test cases 11 - 100 will satisfy no additional constraints

INPUT FORMAT (file fileio.in):
The first line contains an integer N (0≤N≤10^5)

OUTPUT FORMAT (file fileio.out):
Output, on a single line, N.

SAMPLE INPUT:
1

SAMPLE OUTPUT:
1
